    "The most conspicuous feature in the screenshot is that the amplitudes of signals are integral multiples of a unit amplitude. In this example, the green trace has an amplitude 2 times as large as that of the orange trace. If one integrates the area under the signals, the area values will concentrate at integral multiples of a certain area, forming peaks with a equal distance."
