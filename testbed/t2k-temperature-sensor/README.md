# t2k-temperature-sensor

The lab has a buch of old temperature sensors used for former T2K project.
The way to communicate with the board is through RS232.

Tested on windows with the Tera Term Pro, readings can be retrieved from RS232.
Now, to make it more cross-platform, python with serial modules are attempted.
